                My professional goals are that after I graduate from the University of Maryland, I want to be a software developer and, hopefully, be able to create important programs. The industry that I want to be involved in is the computer science industry. I would
                like to, hopefully, get into one of the companies that I am intereseted in. The types of companies that I am interested in working for are tech companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, consulting companies, such as Leidos, Booz
                Allen Hamilton, and IBM, and other major companies, such as Boeing and Toyota.
